# Intro 
HypeTribe is a collaborative social platform for the creation of digital art and user-generated content. Powered by Web3, it allows the integration of royalties, monetisation of raw data for AI training, and data ownership into the flows of SMM and digital co-creation.

## Key features
- Monetisation of raw data for AI training through Data DAOs
- AI-Proof of IP ownership through verification & NFT
- Inherent and editable Royalty feature right at creation
- Performance-based retrospective rewards for creators (to benefit proportionally from viral content)
- Fair copyright model 
- Art gets minted to NFT right at creation, making it uniquely identifiable and associated with the Creator
- Advanced and cross-platform social features, social graph for collaborations and recommendation services

HypeTribe is designed as a transformative ecosystem for digital content, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address the pressing needs of the modern creators' community. It's a comprehensive solution with a marketplace for digital art and UGC and tools to create the art on the platform. It provides a collaborative space for artists and micro-influencers to forge connections and create together. By integrating blockchain technology for secure transactions, ownership rights, and a better reward system, HypeTribe aims to democratize digital content creation and management, making it more accessible and engaging.
