# Intro 
HypeTribe is a collaborative social platform for the creation of digital art and user-generated content. Powered by Web3, it allows the integration of royalties, monetisation of raw data for AI training, and data ownership into the flows of SMM and digital co-creation.

## Key features
- Monetisation of raw data for AI training through Data DAOs
- AI-Proof of IP ownership through verification & NFT
- Inherent and editable Royalty feature right at creation
- Performance-based retrospective rewards for creators (to benefit proportionally from viral content)
- Fair copyright model 
- Art gets minted to NFT right at creation, making it uniquely identifiable and associated with the Creator
- Advanced and cross-platform social features, social graph for collaborations and recommendation services

HypeTribe is designed as a transformative ecosystem for digital content, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address the pressing needs of the modern creators' community. It's a comprehensive solution with a marketplace for digital art and UGC and tools to create the art on the platform. It provides a collaborative space for artists and micro-influencers to forge connections and create together. By integrating blockchain technology for secure transactions, ownership rights, and a better reward system, HypeTribe aims to democratize digital content creation and management, making it more accessible and engaging.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
